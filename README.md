# Traffic Light System
The project makes a 4-way intersection and a street lamp. Using Arduino (C++) to create functional traffic lights.

This project was created on a square cardboard base, which was designed using construction paper to depict pavement and roads. Every detail was meticulously measured and placed to enhance the overall appearance. The traffic lights were crafted from popsicle sticks, straws, LEDs, and electrical wires, with the wires soldered to the LEDs. The wiring for the traffic lights was neatly guided through straws, which acted as poles, anchored in holes made in the cardboard to route the wires underneath. These wires were connected to a breadboard and Arduinos mounted above the board for easy access and thematic consistency. The Arduino code was uploaded to control the traffic lights, simulating a real-life intersection with a 15-second light cycle. A street lamp, placed near the intersection, was made using a yellow LED, a BBQ skewer, and a popsicle stick, programmed to turn on in darkness. Together, these elements form a functional intersection model.
